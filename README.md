Stacks is an organization app. It helps you put everything exactly where they should be. A card is the smallest unit of information. It is of several types, including plain texts, pictures, code snippets and more. Cards and placeholders are *stacked* on (or rather under) columns. A page may have one or more columns. Pages (not to be confused with the macOS/iOS document app) is the highest level of organization.

## Unit Information (Ideal Support)

- (optional) title, (optional) sub-title, plain text (with paragraphs)
- basic markdown document (without images)
- full markdown document (with images, etc)
- hyper-markdown document (with latex embeded)
- single image
- single audio embeded
- single video embeded
- (placeholder) nothing
